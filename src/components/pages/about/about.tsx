            Giving Everyone The Power To Quickly And Easily Create A Custom
            Resume Website
          </h1>
          <p>
            From business professionals, to freelance developers and everyone in
            between, we know job hunting is hard. You spend countless hours
            sending emails and applying to jobs only to never receive a call
            back. Having a personal website allows you to turn more of those
            emails and applications into opportunities. A resume can only say so
            much about you, say more by having your skills and talents on the
            web for the world to see.

              <h1>A website in minutes, not hours</h1>
              <p>
                Youâ€™ve spent hours creating the perfect resume to help you get
                hired, so why not turn all that effort into a website? Unlike
                other website creation sites, we donâ€™t have complicated user
                interfaces or website builders. You donâ€™t need to be tech genius
                or a visual design pro to get a website that looks good and
                performs great across all devices. What takes hours with our
                competitors takes minutes with us.

              <p>
                No restrictive licenses or scary contracts to sign. Zero. Nada.
                Zilch. From the very moment you create your website you own it
                in its entirety, forever. When you use other website creation
                tools they own your content and your ideas. They can take down
                your website, sell it to others, or force you to make changes
                you donâ€™t want. At Resume Charge, you can do whatever you want
                with your website. Want to host it somewhere else? Awesome! Want
                to share your source code with a friend? Do it!
